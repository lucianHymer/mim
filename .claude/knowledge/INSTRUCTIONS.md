# Knowledge Protocol

Use `remember()` immediately on discovery. Every token costs permanent context.

## Rules
- ONE fact per entry. No filler.
- 2-3 sentences max in `details`.
- Include file paths.
- Categories: architecture, patterns, dependencies, workflows, gotchas (or any)

## Trigger Phrases
"I learned that", "turns out", "actually it's", "for future reference" -> REMEMBER IT

## Good vs Bad
BAD: "The system uses Redis for session caching with a TTL of 30 minutes configured in the cache middleware."
GOOD: "Session cache: Redis, 30min TTL. Config: `src/middleware/cache.ts`."
