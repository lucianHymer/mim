# Mím - Persistent Memory for Claude Code

Norse mythology tells of Mímir, guardian of the Wellspring beneath Yggdrasil
where all knowledge pools and swirls. The Vanir claimed his head. Odin
claimed it back. Now preserved in herbs and rune-magic, the severed head
whispers secrets from the cosmic deep - deathless, sleepless, all-remembering.

Mím captures what Claude Code discovers in its wanderings, preserving each
insight in an ever-growing Wellspring of Knowledge.
Nothing learned is lost.
Every discovery feeds the depths.

What dies in context lives eternal in the Wellspring.
